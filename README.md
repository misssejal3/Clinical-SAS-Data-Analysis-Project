ðŸ“Š Clinical SAS Projects
This repository contains hands-on SAS Clinical Programming projects simulating real-world clinical trial data analysis. Each project demonstrates dataset preparation, analysis, and creation of Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) used in regulatory submissions.

01 ðŸ©º Clinical Trial Safety Dashboard (Adverse Events Analysis)
A SAS-based project analyzing mock clinical trial safety data to generate listings, summaries, and visualizations of adverse events across treatment groups.

Highlights:
Created AE (Adverse Events), DM (Demographics), and EX (Exposure) datasets.
Wrote SAS programs to clean and merge datasets.
Generated safety tables, patient listings, and severity-wise bar charts using PROC REPORT and PROC SGPLOT.
Exported results in RTF/PDF reports for reporting.

ðŸ“‚ Deliverables:
data/ â†’ datasets (CSV & SAS)
programs/ â†’ SAS programs for TLFs
outputs/ â†’ final reports (PDF/RTF)


02 ðŸ’Š Efficacy Analysis of Clinical Trial (Endpoint Evaluation)
A SAS project simulating efficacy analysis by evaluating changes from baseline in lab results, vital signs, and tumor response, with summary tables and efficacy graphs.

Highlights:
Created LB (Lab Results), VS (Vital Signs), TR (Tumor Response) datasets.
Calculated change from baseline (e.g., HbA1c, BP, tumor size).
Summarized efficacy endpoints by treatment arm (mean Â± SD).
Produced line plots and summary tables to represent primary and secondary endpoints.

ðŸ“‚ Deliverables:
data/ â†’  datasets
programs/ â†’ SAS efficacy analysis programs
outputs/ â†’ summary tables, graphs, and reports
