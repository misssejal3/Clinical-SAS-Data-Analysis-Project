🧪 Clinical SAS Safety Dashboard
A real-world style Clinical SAS project demonstrating patient safety data analysis in a clinical trial. The project uses datasets to generate regulatory-style TLFs (Tables, Listings, and Figures) with SAS.

📌 Project Overview
This project simulates the work of a Clinical SAS Programmer in analyzing Adverse Events (AEs) and patient safety data. It covers the full workflow from data import → cleaning → analysis → reporting.

Key highlights:
Import and process clinical datasets (dm, ex, ae).
Generate summary tables of adverse events by treatment group.
Create patient-level listings for detailed safety review.
Produce safety graphs (AE severity & seriousness) with PROC SGPLOT.
Deliver outputs in regulatory submission formats (RTF, PNG).

⚙️ Methods & Tools
SAS Procedures: PROC IMPORT, PROC SQL, PROC FREQ, PROC REPORT, PROC SGPLOT.
Outputs: Tables (RTF), Listings (RTF), Graphs (PNG).
Concepts Applied: Data merging, grouping, summary stats, clinical trial reporting.

📊 Deliverables
Adverse Event Summary Table – Frequency of AEs by treatment group.
Patient-Level AE Listing – Subject ID, demographics, treatment, AE details.
AE Severity Distribution Graph – Bar chart of mild/moderate/severe cases.
Serious vs Non-Serious Graph – Safety signal visualization.

🚀 How to Run
Place the datasets inside the data/ folder.
Open each .sas program in SAS.

Run in order:
01_import_data.sas
02_summary_tables.sas
03_adverse_event_listing.sas
04_safety_graphs.sas
View results inside the outputs/ folder.

🎯 Learning Outcomes
Hands-on practice with Clinical SAS programming.
Realistic safety data reporting workflow.
Demonstrated ability to create TLFs for regulatory submission.
